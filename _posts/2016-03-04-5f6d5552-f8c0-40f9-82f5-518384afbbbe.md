It was a crisp, sunny afternoon on Stanford University's campus when I arrived with three fellows from [FactoryX Academy][0]. We'd been invited to spend a few hours with students in [d.school, Stanford's Institude of Design][1], for a class called "[Civic Dreams, Human Spaces][2]."

FactoryX uses Prototype Thinking to experiment with rapidly creating products and starting companies. It is a methodology that is focused on a rapid rate of learning and the idea of thinking by doing, so we thought this sign we found outside the classroom was pretty perfect.

The Academy team at FactoryX is focused on teaching Prototype Thinking to entrepreneurs and startup professionals. We taught some of our methodologies to the d.school students last week, particularly user testing techniques, focusing on their civic projects' sensitive audiences --- for example, how to approach a street vendor or a homeless individual for an interview.

Here are a few key things we told the students about user testing and prototyping ideas:

1. Don't think of your user as someone you're testing. Think of your user as a subject-matter expert on the topic of the problem you're solving. They are an expert living in the thick of that problem. Learn as much as you can from their expertise with great respect for their knowledge, as if you were inviting them to give a guest lecture or teach a class.
2. While you want to go into a user test with a prototype to show, don't go in with the intention of testing that prototype for a pass/fail judgement. It's almost irrelevant what your test participant thinks of your prototype --- the prototype is a way to invite them to share with you their mental model and worldview in the context of your problem space.
3. Remain flexible --- if the test participant isn't willing to engage with your prototype in the way you thought, change the prototype, or abandon it in favor of something else. Bring paper, markers, tape, etc. and create something new based on the interactions you've had so far to see if you can get them to engage and share their expertise with you another way.

This perspective has stuck with me in work settings, and I hope it will for you, too. It puts a nice shift on how I've always thought about user testing, and makes me feel more curious, excited, and interested in the conversation itself, not just the results of the test.
